## OAR closure status

The Bounded Calendar Authority Chain v0 architecture is frozen. PR #18 accepted and merged the OAR contracts, inactive Draft 0.x schemas, and fictional authority/revocation fixtures. PR #19 accepted and merged the fictional year-2099 offline authority verifier prototype. PR #21 completed Phase 1A deterministic verifier core hardening without activating any contract or schema.

The prototype verifies RFC 8785/SHA-256 bindings, a separately supplied fictional trust anchor, the non-self-authorizing registry-publication bootstrap, ordinary closed-world membership, exact subject/envelope binding, authorized revocation before authority supersession, independent business-subject supersession, deterministic fictional outcomes, two positive scenarios, and twenty negative first-failure cases. PR #19 historically merged at 147 passed with one pre-existing unrelated skip. The current Phase 1A validation baseline is 172 passed with that same unrelated skip, plus passing Ubuntu and Windows CI on Python 3.11 and 3.12.

The verifier is executable fictional evidence only. It is not production-ready, does not activate any Draft 0.x schema, and does not implement operational trust-anchor delivery, real registry publication, or real authority issuance.

## Active implemented contracts

- `docs/pipeline-run-contract.md` — D1 auditable run contract.
- `docs/output-contracts.md` — validator output contracts.

## Proposed inactive contracts

- `docs/contracts/newsletter-fixture-publication-admission-contract-v0.md` — Draft revision 3 fixture-first architecture contract proposed for bounded closure review. It is not Owner-accepted, not implemented, runtime-inactive, and grants no runtime or production publication authority.

## Accepted inactive architecture contracts

- `docs/contracts/newsletter-publication-boundary-contract-v0.md` — Owner-accepted as a normative architecture boundary at exact head `cfef8a8fae74cd628f085022287683d597bc38cf`. It is not implemented, is not runtime-active, and does not authorize production activation.

Calendar-only architecture and retained contracts:

- `docs/contracts/calendar-only-vertical-slice-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/calendar-projection-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/external-authority-registry-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/calendar-only-fictional-fixture-test-matrix.md`

The external-authority-registry draft remains inactive and is not the anchored closed-world OAR snapshot.

OAR and bounded-input contracts:

- `docs/contracts/authority-resolution-input-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/authority-subject-boundary-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/owner-authority-envelope-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/calendar-eligibility-subject-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/calendar-monthly-selection-subject-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/run-metadata-binding-subject-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/authority-revocation-subject-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/registry-publication-bootstrap-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/registry-snapshot-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/resolution-bundle-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/trust-anchor-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/authority-lifecycle-resolution-contract.md`
- `docs/contracts/authority-resolution-enforcement-matrix.md`
- `docs/contracts/bounded-authority-fictional-fixture-test-matrix.md`
- `docs/contracts/oar-draft-migration-plan.md`

Inactive Draft 0.x schemas:

- `schemas/drafts/calendar-only/external-authority-registry.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/calendar-only/calendar-activity-projection.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/calendar-only/calendar-monthly-manifest.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/bounded-authority-input/trust-anchor.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/bounded-authority-input/authority-registry-snapshot.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/bounded-authority-input/resolution-bundle-root.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/owner-authority-resolution/authority-envelope.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/owner-authority-resolution/authority-revocation-subject.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/owner-authority-resolution/calendar-eligibility-subject.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/owner-authority-resolution/calendar-monthly-selection-subject.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/owner-authority-resolution/registry-publication-subject.schema.json`
- `schemas/drafts/owner-authority-resolution/run-metadata-binding-subject.schema.json`

These schemas are not runtime inputs and remain inactive despite successful fictional prototype verification.

## Fictional fixtures and verifier navigation

Accepted fictional scenarios:

- `examples/contract-fixtures/owner-authority-resolution/positive/pre-revocation/`
- `examples/contract-fixtures/owner-authority-resolution/positive/post-revocation/`
- `examples/contract-fixtures/bounded-authority-input/negative/negative-cases.json`

Fictional-only offline verifier:

- `tools/oar_verifier/`
- `tools/oar_verifier/limits.py`
- `tools/verify_fictional_authority.py`

Verifier tests:

- `tests/test_oar_canonical.py`
- `tests/test_oar_positive_scenarios.py`
- `tests/test_oar_negative_cases.py`
- `tests/test_oar_fail_closed.py`
- `tests/test_oar_concurrency.py`
- `tests/test_oar_lifecycle_invariants.py`
- `tests/test_oar_resource_limits.py`
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

Phase 1A removed module-global trace state, added invocation-local internal test tracing, deterministic fixed resource ceilings, distinct `resource_rejection` classification, fail-closed business-key ambiguity handling, and cycle/depth protection. These implementation safeguards remain fictional-only and do not activate an inactive contract or Draft 0.x schema.

## Historical Gate 2 context

At Gate 2, the bounded-input fixtures proved only the trusted-tip, closed-world snapshot, bundle-completeness, ordering, and run-metadata envelope. Executable owner-authority verification was then a separate blocker. PR #18 supplied the accepted OAR contract and fixture package, and PR #19 resolved the fictional-verifier blocker.

The production boundary remains unresolved and unauthorized: fictional verification does not provide real trust-anchor delivery, real registry publication, real authority/revocation issuance, R03 eligibility or selection, projection or manifest activation, calendar downstream activation, BR-006 activation, D3 resolution, or published-output recall.
